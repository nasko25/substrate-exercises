Kitties Breed Pallet Design

Kitty breed pallet:
    if last dna digit is even -> male kitty
    else                      -> female kitty

Breed ->
    check genders of parents
    either put the parents DNAs where the new kitty’s DNA is generated
                OR
    split the new kitty’s DNA in two parts: the first will be composed of an xor of the parent’s DNAs (or some combination of the two parents’ DNAs) and the last 64 bits will be random
